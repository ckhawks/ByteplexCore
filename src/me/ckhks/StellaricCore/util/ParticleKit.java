    // basically just make this a player particle database thing.
    // separate into particle types: object/gameplay, player effect, player trail, arrow trail
    // enums are fun I think? don't think they will work well for this in case I want need a particle that has special data (such as speed or direction or...
    //   if I want a specific shape but a different actual particle (flame instead of smoke or something))
